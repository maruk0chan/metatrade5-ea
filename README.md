# What is this?

A repository which records my learning progress of creating my own [Expert Advisors](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/mt5/expert_advisors)(EAs).\
I put every EA template in [Custom](https://github.com/maruk0chan/metatrade5-ea/tree/master/Custom) and feel free to check it out.

# Are you interested in trading bot?

I can't tell you much about it because I just started learning.\
But if you're interested in it, you can read more details from [Step-By-Step Guide to writing an Expert Advisor in MQL5 for Beginners
